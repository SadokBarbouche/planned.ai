# Planned.AI (Demo Version)

Welcome to Planned.AI! This is the inaugural version, serving as a demonstration for our PFA project. Planned.AI aims to revolutionize trip planning by harnessing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create personalized itineraries for users.

## Features
- Utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized trip itineraries.
- Offers tailored recommendations based on user preferences and destination choices.
- Fine-tuned with SOTA PEFT techniques using the free T4 GPU on Google Colab.
- Built on The LangChain framework for seamless integration.

## Acknowledgments
- **Google Maps Scraper:** Collecting data made possible thanks to the amazing [google-maps-scraper](https://github.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper) tool. Kudos to the developers behind it!
- **ArcGIS API:** Obtaining the exact location of each place was made possible thanks to the ArcGIS API.
- **Q&A Dataset:** The q&a dataset for fine-tuning was created using the `gemini-pro` Large Language Model (LLM) from Google.

This version of Planned.AI is just the beginning. We are actively planning for further enhancements and refinements. Your feedback and contributions are highly valued as we continue to develop and improve Planned.AI. Stay tuned for updates and join us in shaping the future of trip planning!
